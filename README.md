Repo for the Steam User Stats Bot, a Discord bot for steam user stat.
To run, make sure the `DISCORDKEY` environment variable is set to your bot's API key.

This bot uses sqlite to store user information (such as a user's Steam User Id and API key). It's highly recommended to mount `/app/data` to persist user data.
